These footprints are for Hongfa relays of type HFD3 in SMD and THT shape. They come with 10 pins or 8 pins to be soldered directly or through holes of the PCB.

These footprints can be added to an existing global footprint library under

/usr/share/kicad/footprints/Relay_SMD.pretty

/usr/share/kicad/footprints/Relay_THT.pretty

or if necessary in a separate library like

/usr/share/kicad/footprints/myRelay_SMD.pretty

/usr/share/kicad/footprints/myRelay_THT.pretty

The necessary rights of each library for proper use with kicad shall be set accordingly.
