These footprints are for Haofang HFD3 relay in SMD shape. They come with 10 pins or 8 pins to be soldered directly on the PCB.

These footprints can be added to an existing global footprint library under

/usr/share/kicad/footprints/Relay_SMD.pretty

or if necessary in a separate library like

/usr/share/kicad/footprints/myRelay_SMD.pretty

The rights of each library shall be set accordingly.
